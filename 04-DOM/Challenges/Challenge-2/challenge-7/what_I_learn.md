# New logic what I learned from the simple Accordion Project

## Accordion meaning:-

- First I know that Accordion is a musical Instrument ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚

## Logics :-

### CSS :-

- I get to know about the css tranform properties which takes value in degree.
- Before knowing this I change the button innerText as the upper arrow sign and down arrow sign
- Then I get to know about transform property (from Chatgpt)

### JS :-

- When I try to think how can I close the remaining buttons paragraph when open one of those.
- Then I get to know about the parentElement from one of my peers code.
- Jab ek perticular paragrph ko open karna hai uska button ko click karke, uske parent ko ham consider kar sakte hai, uski parent ke elements ko chhod ke baki sab band kardo.
