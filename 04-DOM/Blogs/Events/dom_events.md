# DOM Events

## DOM

- DOM (Document Object Model) represents the structure of an HTML or XML document as a tree of objects. Each element, attribute, and text node in the document is a node in this tree.
- The DOM tree consists of a hierarchy where the document is the root node, and all elements are its children.
- Events in the DOM allow interaction with elements. Examples include click, mouseover, keydown, etc. Event listeners can be attached to nodes to handle these interactions.
