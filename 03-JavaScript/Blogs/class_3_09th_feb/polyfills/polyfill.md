- Polyfill is a JavaScript library that provides missing or polyfill functionality for older browsers.
- Not for only older browser, but for new browser also
- If I want to design a app, and there is some JavaScript function which are unknwon for browser, I have to design my own polyfills and send it to the browser before my page loads, otherwise my app will crash in the browser.

## Why we need Polyfills ?

- Let us go with a real life example.
  > Imagine your phoneâ€™s storage is completely full, but you need to save some important files to a USB pendrive.

> Problem?

- Your phone doesnâ€™t have a USB Type-A port to directly connect the pendrive.

> Solution?

- You use a Type-A to Type-C connector to bridge the gap and make the pendrive compatible with your phone. In the same way, a polyfill acts as a connector in JavaScript, allowing older browsers (that lack modern features) to access and use those features, ensuring everything works smoothly.
