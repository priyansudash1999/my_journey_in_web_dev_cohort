# Markdown Previewer

#### Build a simple readme markdown previewer that allows users to enter markdown text in a textarea and display the formatted preview in real time without any extra API calls to backend. You may use a js Markdown parser like marked.js or write your own basic parser. This assignment will help you practice working with user input, text processing, and dynamically updating the DOM based on user interactions.
